# Hi there.

</div>

I'm a software engineer at the [Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Ciudad Madero](https://www.cdmadero.tecnm.mx), I really love web development and research, that's why I know both Frontend and Backend.

Although my heart is in the Frontend.

I create things in my free time to test new knowledge or simply for the passion and fun of creating new things.
